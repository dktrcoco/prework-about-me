      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>Hey everybody! I'm Chris and I am learning about coding and software development. I am transitioning from a career as a chemist due to the Covid-19 Pandemic.</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I grew up and went to school in the Pittsburgh PA area. Now my wife and I live in Chicago IL.</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>I'm into a bunch of stuff. In no particular order: Racquetball, gaming, reading, writing, fitness, learning, Pittsburgh Sports.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>I don't really have a dream job. When I was young I wanted to be an astronaut so I could go to space, and I guess that's still true so I'll go with that.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>My wife and I recently bought a house in the Andersonville neighborhood of the city of Chicago IL.</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>This is a new challenge for me that I think will be more family-friendly in terms of work schedule. It's hard to work from home as a chemist.</p>
